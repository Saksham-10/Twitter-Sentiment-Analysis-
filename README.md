# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-
It is a Natural Language Processing Problem where Sentiment Analysis is done by Classifying the Positive tweets from negative tweets by machine learning models for classification, text mining, text analysis, data analysis and data visualization.
The basic objective is to detect hate speech in tweets by classifying them as 0 (non hate) or 1 (hate).
A labelled dataset of 32000 tweets has been taken to train and test the model.
Here I have used Logistic Regression Algorithm to achieve a maximum accuracy of 94.5%.
